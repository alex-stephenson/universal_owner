"Last year Australian investors put forward a resolution at Origin Energy's AGM, challenging its membership of six trade bodies that lobbied against tightening Australian policies on carbon emissions. The motion was backed by 46% of investors """" but BlackRock opposed it."
"Will Baylis, portfolio manager for Martin Currie Australia, said BlackRock's ""relatively loose"" target would not capture stocks such as AGL Energy, Aurizon, South 32, CIMIC Group, Downer Group and Origin Energy, all of which have some exposure to thermal coal."
"BlackRock Inc. last month said it would exit debt and equity investments in thermal coal producers across its active portfolios. Europe's largest pension fund Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP last week pledged that its investments would be climate neutral by 2050, while U.K.'s Brunel Pension Partnership in January threatened to fire managers that fail to curb exposure to climate change and position for a low-carbon economy. ""We've seen a spike in Australians connecting the bushfires to climate change, and then to how they're investing their money,"" said Simon O'Connor, chief executive officer of the Responsible Investment Association Australasia. ""The onus is on funds to set really strong, quantifiable targets and then demonstrate they're moving in the direction of meeting those targets."" The world's fourth-largest pension pool has to date resisted meaningful change. While funds pepper their corporate reports with sections on environmental, social and governance practices and appoint ESG heads, they've steadfastly held onto positions in climate-change offenders, like Glencore PLC and Whitehaven Coal Ltd. Voting stick The belief is that by staying invested, funds can pressure companies to start changing their practices. There's also always the threat of voting against company directors at annual meetings if progress isn't made. That's an approach Boston-based money manager State Street Corp. has adopted, recommending board members of firms that have been ""consistently under performing"" peers in the asset manager's ESG scoring system not be reinstated. State Street has also taken aim at activist shareholders that create confusion for investors without tackling material issues for long-term stakeholders, a sentiment Australia's pension funds share. But in Australia, funds' environmental local voting record is poor, according to international corporate governance specialists Proxy Insight. Among asset managers with at least $10 billion under management, only VicSuper supported all climate-change resolutions during the 2018-19 annual meeting season. Funds including IOOF Holdings Ltd., UniSuper, Retail Employees Superannuation Trust and Equipsuper failed to vote for any resolutions while those including AMP Ltd., First State Super and Sunsuper supported 50% or less. ""Pension funds have been telling us for years they've been engaging with investee companies to improve their climate performance,"" said William van de Pol, a Melbourne-based asset-management campaigner at environmental lobby group Market Forces. ""But we haven't seen that translate into any strategic shifts that would suggest the major contributors to climate change are actually changing their business models."" The pressure on pension funds to take more decisive action is mounting. Around 80% of Australians are worried about climate change, with the recent bushfire crisis intensifying concerns, a study last month of 1,033 people by The Australia Institute found. Members sue Retail Employees Superannuation Trust, a fund for retail workers that manages around AU$60 billion, is being sued by one of its own members for not adequately assessing the impact of climate change on its holdings. And some 8,100 members of UniSuper, which manages AU$85 billion, signed an open letter in January demanding the Melbourne-based fund scrap investments in firms that are expanding their fossil fuel output. The broader finance industry isn't immune either. Last month, a group of bushfire survivors banded with environment group Friends of the Earth in a legal claim against Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., accusing the lender of financing the climate crisis through funding for fossil fuel projects, local media reported. To be sure, pension funds have made some inroads. BHP Group has pledged to power two of its copper mines in Chile via renewable energy by the middle of the decade as it succumbs to pressure from funds to improve its environmental record. It's also said to be moving ahead with plans to exit thermal coal production. Origin Energy Ltd. has spent more than AU$800 million in order to source more than one-quarter of its energy-generation mix from renewable energy this year, company disclosures show. AGL Energy Ltd., the nation's largest owner of coal-fired electricity assets, has created an up to AU$3 billion fund to unlock investment in large-scale renewable energy in partnership with Queensland Investment Corp. on behalf of its clients, including Australia's Future Fund. The legal requirement for many of Australia's pension funds to return 3.5% above inflation over a decade is an added complication. Money managers must look after members' best financial interests and excluding a whole segment of an economy where returns may still be robust can present a challenge. For example, while BHP and Rio Tinto Group are among the developed world's most-polluting energy and mining companies when emissions from their customers are taken into account, they're also among the most profitable, data compiled by Bloomberg show. ""It's easy to have a slogan,"" said Raphael Arndt, the Future Fund's chief investment officer. ""But if someone says 'Get rid of fossil fuel companies,' do I sell AGL? That's also my biggest exposure to renewables."" Still, funds shouldn't expect the pressure to let off. ""The presence of natural disasters like bushfires has put sustainability in the spotlight,"" said Jessica Melville, the head of strategic advisory, investments, for Willis Towers Watson. ""We expect this to grow in importance with a significant reallocation of capital likely over the next decade, especially with respect to climate change."" -- Matthew Burgess, Bloomberg"
"Accordingly, the voting technology used by companies will need to allow for live participation and casting of votes by multiple custodians at one time, on behalf of multiple clients, which may present difficulties.Secondly, a key advantage of the proxy voting process which occurs prior to the AGM is that boards of companies are aware of the likely result of the resolutions proposed for the meeting at least 48 hours prior to the commencement of the meeting, given the usual practice of shareholders to vote by proxy form rather than by attending the meeting in person. As a result, company boards may be reluctant to adopt online voting processes which take place at the time of meetings as it may leave them open to unexpected outcomes. Executive remuneration ASIC reports that there has been an overall increase in the number of ""for"" votes on remuneration reports over the course of 2016 and 2017. The reasons attributed to this increase include the active engagement (of directors) with shareholders and changes being made to remuneration structures, reducing complexity and withholding bonus payments. Unsurprisingly, excessive quantum of pay (when assessed against performance), pay structure and lack of transparency, continue to be key factors contributing to companies receiving votes against remuneration reports.In light of this, to improve shareholder participation and increase votes in favour of remuneration reports, ASIC recommends that companies adopt long-term incentive structures, including non-financial targets, and avoid complexity in the design of their incentive structures. Election of directors Interestingly, despite ASIC's observation of the ""buoyant state of the market"" in 2017, the overall sentiment towards directors was found to be more negative, with resolutions for the election of directors receiving a higher number of ""against"" votes than in 2016. ASIC found this was an indication of shareholders expressing their dissatisfaction with company performance by voting against the election of directors. This additionally reflects the greater focus and scrutiny by shareholders on the extent to which board members have the appropriate qualifications and industry experience to lead their companies.However, material ""against"" votes (ie. resolutions that received a vote of 10% or more against the resolution) generally decreased since 2016 in respect of other resolutions such as those relating to KMP remuneration and constitutional change. Proxy advisers Despite the ongoing debate in corporate Australia around the role of proxy advisers (particularly in relation to their ability to influence outcomes of meetings and attract significant media attention), ASIC appears to be in favour of proxy advisers and their beneficial involvement in company meetings and governance issues. ASIC states: ""We recognise the important role proxy advisers play in the market by assisting shareholders in making voting decisions and promoting focus on corporate governance issues."" In 2017, proxy advisers were active in scrutinising companies' governance practices and were found to have issued ""against"" recommendations for 148 of a total of 1,125 proposed resolutions. These were mainly for resolutions relating to director election, KMP remuneration and remuneration reports, highlighting their role in increasing transparency for the benefit of shareholders. We note that the analysis on proxy advisers does not include shareholder-requisitioned resolutions.The Report notes that resolutions which attracted ""against"" recommendations from proxy advisers received a lower average ""for"" vote and resolutions that attracted no ""against"" recommendations received higher average ""for"" votes, evidencing the influence of proxy advisers over company outcomes and voting processes. Nonetheless, the Report points out that the average ""against"" vote for all resolutions attracting at least one ""against"" recommendation of a proxy adviser was not sufficiently significant to alter the outcome of the resolution.The analysis on proxy advisers was conducted on the basis of data voluntarily provided to ASIC by three major proxy advisers, suggesting the positive relationship between ASIC and major proxy advisers and ASIC's favourable view towards proxy advisers and their role in corporate governance. Furthermore, ASIC recommends that companies engage early and proactively with proxy advisers, as an extension of companies' ongoing engagement with shareholders, and that companies release notices of meeting to the market early and ensure disclosure to the market is clear and not overly complex. Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) issues On the topic of shareholder engagement, ASIC made a number of observations and recommendations on the steps taken by shareholders to enact policies which respond to ESG-related issues. ASIC observed that there was little support for such resolutions from non-requisitioning shareholders.Notably, shareholders of seven ASX 200 companies (predominantly mining and exploration companies) requisitioned ESG-related resolutions in the 2017 AGM season. Fewer than 10% of shareholders supported resolutions in favour of climate change and human rights issues for the following companies: BHP Billiton Limited, Santos Limited, Origin Energy Limited, Downer EDI Limited, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, and Oil Search Limited. We note that although ESG-related resolutions were requisitioned by shareholders, they were ultimately unsuccessful.Nonetheless, ASIC has noted the increasing trend for shareholders to requisition ESG-related resolutions and recommends that boards carefully consider and manage ""all material and emerging risks relevant to their company"", including those related to ESG outcomes. ASIC made reference to a report it prepared on corporate finance regulation in August 2017, ASIC noted that ""companies and their boards should proactively consider reporting on climate risk as part of their annual reports."" In the same report, ASIC also warned listed entities of their disclosure obligations relating to future financial years in accordance with Section 299A of the Corporations Act.In an open letter to chief executive officers, Larry Fink, the chairman and CEO of BlackRock, Inc., noted a growing trend in society turning to the private sector to address broader social issues as a result of governments failing to do so. Furthermore, the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) has also made a number of recommendations in relation to broadening the disclosure obligations of companies to ensure that shareholders are made aware of the financial impact of climate change.Growing societal demand for companies to take proactive steps to manage ESG-related issues raises further questions in relation to governance issues and directors' duties. Larry Fink has adopted a sustainability focused approach which maintains that companies exist to benefit all stakeholders, therefore qualifying the shareholder primacy principles.Although this does not technically fall within any legal obligation of directors, this nonetheless serves as a reminder to boards of the need to be aware of the risks involved in failing to adopt proactive policies to tackling increasing ESG-related shareholder demands.Clayton Utz communications are intended to provide commentary and general information.
